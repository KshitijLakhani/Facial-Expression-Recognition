# Facial Expression Recognition 

The initial repo was cloned from https://github.com/jrishabh96/Facial-Expression-Recognition.git .
Data Augmentation and Hyper - parameter tuning along with interactive features were added to it to obtain, possibly, the highest known accuracy on the fer2013 dataset of 78.51%. This was achieved in collaboration with Shreenath Iyer (https://github.com/ShreenathIyer) and Nehal Agrawal (https://www.linkedin.com/in/nehalagrawal/) - big thanks ! 
The report for this can be referred for further information.
